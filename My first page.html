        <h2>Steps taken for greatness</h2>
        <p>Please note that the steps are not presented in any particular order, so feel free to follow them in whatever order you like, as long as they are <strong>all</strong> followed.</p>

        <p>There you have my three tips for greatness. Pretty simple, right?</p>
        <p>Don't hesitate to share them with your friends (heck, even your enemies, why not?) and I hope they help you out!</p>

    <h3 id="cookies">1. Cookies</h3>
    <p>Personally, I enjoy baking matcha chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, peanut butter cookies, and salt chocolate chip shortbread.</p>
    <p>I understand that the latter is not technically a cookie as no egg is used, but they are still delicious.</p>
    <p>All of them are feel-good snacks and even better when shared with your loved ones (not with enemies in this case).</p>

    <h3 id="dogs">2. Dogs</h3>
    <p>Dogs, dogs dogs. Where to begin? We humans surely don't deserve them!</p>
    <p>For maximum cuteness, I personally recommend the fluffiest dogs possible, such as Alaskan malamutes, samoyedes or Australian shepherd dogs:</p>
    <figure class="box">
        <div class="element1"><a href="alaskan.jpeg"><img src="small_alaskan.jpg" alt="Alaskan malamute" title="Click here for a bigger picture!" class="pic" /></a> <figcaption><strong><span class="exhibits">Exhibit A.</span></strong> Alaskan malamutes</figcaption></div>
        <div class="element2"><a href="samoyed.jpg"><img src="small_samoyed.jpg" alt="Samoyed" title="Click here for a bigger picture!" class="pic" /></a><figcaption><strong><span class="exhibits">Exhibit B.</span></strong> Samoyeds</figcaption></div>
        <div class="element3"><a href="australian.jpeg"><img src="small_australian.jpg" alt="Australian shepherd" title="Click here for a bigger picture!" class="pic" /></a> <figcaption><strong><span class="exhibits">Exhibit C.</span></strong> Australian shepherds</figcaption></div>
        </div>
    </figure>
    <p>In any case, any and all dogs are a godsend and you should choose your canine companion(s) as you like! They will 100% make you happy.</p>
    <p>Even when they're being difficult, it is known that all dogs are the goodest boys and girls.</p>

    <h3 id="bubble">3. Bubble tea</h3>
    <p>When I refer to the time-old adage - <span class="italics">"a bubble tea a day keeps the doctor away"</span> - please note that only a <em>bubble</em> tea will work for this technique, not just any tea. 
    <p>What is a bubble tea you ask? This <a href="https://www.eater.com/21551108/boba-milk-bubble-tea-explained-how-to-order" title="They originated in Taiwan, not Korea!" target="_blank">site</a> gives a good explanation.</p>
    <p>In terms of flavour, I personally enjoy matcha bubble teas or fruity green tea bubble teas. For those who like milky bubble teas, I also highly recommend brown sugar milk bubble teas!</p>
